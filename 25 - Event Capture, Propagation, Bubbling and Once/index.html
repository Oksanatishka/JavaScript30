            // concept of bubbling, - where the browser will figure out what you clicked on, but it will also trigger clicks up every...and they'll ripple all the way up.
            // How it works? -The way that it works in modern browsers is that the browser will first
            // do something called a capture, which means that when you click on the element,
            // it's going to ripple down. It's going to say, "Okay, you clicked on the body,
            // you clicked on one, you clicked on two, and you clicked on three." So it actually
            // goes from the top down, and then it captures all of those events,
            // and then it starts at the bottom, and then starts doing something called a bubble.
            // So the capture goes from top down, and then the events...the events haven't fired
            // yet. It just captures where you clicked, and is storing them. Then it will start to
            // bubble up, which means that it's triggering the events as you go up.
            // So it says, "Okay, we've done figuring out what you've clicked on all the way down,
            // now I'm going to start firing off those click events," on three,
            // then two, then one, then body, and anything else you're listening for.

                console.log(this);
                console.log(this.classList.value);
                e.stopPropagation(); // "STOP BUBBLING this event up. I clicked the one that I actually wanted."
            }

            // document.body.addEventListener('click', logText);

            // {capture: true} means we will run the function on the way down rather than on the way up.
            // by default it is {capture: false}
            // {once: true} means unbinding itself, is the same thing as saying div.removeEventListener('click', logText).

                div.addEventListener('click', logText, { capture: false, once: true })

            // I've used that is in store checkouts, where you do not wish for someone to click that button more than
            // once, you can unbind it and stop them from clicking it multiple times.
