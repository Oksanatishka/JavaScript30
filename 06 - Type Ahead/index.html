            // 1) First of all, we need an empty array to put our cities into
            const cities = [];
            // Then we need to go out and fetch our data. We're going to be using a new API in the browser called fetch.
            // And if you've done an HTML or XML HTTP request in the browser before, you probably have used like JQuery.dol. JSON or a library like axios. However, the browser now has a new one built in which is called fetch.

            // fetch(endpoint)

            // And what fetch will do, if you're used to maybe running a callback like this

            // fetch(endpoint, function(data){
            //   console.log(data);
            // })

            // it works a little bit differently than that because fetch itself will return what is called a promise
            // and I'll show you that. If you we were to just put this in a variable,

            // const prom = fetch(endpoint);
            // console.log(prom)

            // It doesn't return the data, it returns what's called a promise which is sort of like a something will eventually come back from this fetch.
            // So the way that we can work with the promise is you call .then against it. And it's going to return to us just like a blob of data.
            // I like to call it a blob. And I'll show you why. You might think like, "Oh why, wouldn't that just be the list of
            // cities?" So from that let's console.log ...

            // fetch(endpoint).then(blob => console.log(blob));
            // fetch(endpoint).then(blob => JSON.parse(blob));
