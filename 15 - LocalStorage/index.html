            // LOCAL STORAGE
            // So what we've got here is sort of a [tapas] menu, where you can add things,
            // and then if you want them you can check and uncheck them. But kind of the cool
            // thing, where if you were to type in like "taco", I'm going to say "pork taco",
            // hit Enter, and then when I refresh the page it's still there. If I click on one
            // of them to taco it or check it, as normal people would do, you refresh,
            // it's still going to be there. So that's going to be persisting our state with
            // local storage.

            // EVENT DELEGATION
            // when I add another item here, like fish, and I click on it,
            // I can taco it right away. Why can I do that? Because if you add an event listener
            // on something that doesn't exist, you'll know that in the future it won't be
            // clicked. So we're going to look at that error as well, and use event delegation to fix it.

            function addItem(e) {
                // console.log('Hello'); // it'll dissapear quickly in console, so mark 'Preserve log'
                e.preventDefault(); // that's going to stop the page from reloading. Because by default, a form is just going to reload the page
                // or send the data to an external source, generally what's your server side. In this case, we're going to be doing an all client side
                // console.log('Hi');
                // let text = document.querySelector('input[name="item"]'); // this code is good too
                const text = this.querySelector('[name=item]').value; //this is going to be the actual form.

                const item = {
                    // text: text,
                    text, // ES6 shorthand

                // sometimes you see 'reset' button online on forms
            }

            // every time we add an item, it's recreating the entire list. So if you are really
            // worried about performance, in this case it's not a big deal. It's very,
            // very fast. But if you were doing this maybe every half a second or every second,
            // or you had a bunch of animations, you would want to look at, "How do I update
            // just that one list item that I have, rather than rerender the entire list?"
            // That's where something like React or Angular becomes really helpful,
            // because they're smart enough to know, "Okay. Rather than just blowing away this
            // entire unordered list and rerendering the whole thing, let me just figure out what's
            // the minimum HTML that I need to change on the page without having to change the rest of it.

            // when I refresh the page, that list is not persisting. -> we're going to be storing our data in local storage.
            // how it works? -> you have this object in the browser called "localStorage." But you're able to save text to the
            // browser, and then when you reload the page you'll be able to grab this text out of
            // it. So if you go to your Application tab in Chrome Dev Tools, there's a whole bunch
            // of stuff here. If you go to Local Storage and you click on the domain that you're
            // working on, in this case I'm working locally so it's just "file," you should
            // see that there's a key of Items and a value of something else. Now, you might
            // see a whole bunch of other stuff here, depending if you've ever run other
            // applications on your local host. This is where I've stored the text of what
            // we're going for and the property of done. So how do we actually save that to local storage? ->
            // When we populate the list here, what we also need to do is set this item's
            // array into local storage.
            // Add code below calling for populateList() f-n
            // localStorage.setItem('items', items); // 'items' is key
            //
            // [object Object] - What does that mean? - it's simply just a key value store
            // and you may only use strings in local storage.
            // console.log(items.toString())  // [object Object]
            //  When you try to put something other than a string into local storage,
            // the browser goes, "Oh, I don't know how to handle this. Let me
            // just convert it to a string". So what we actually need to do is
            // stringify it before we convert it.

            // -------- EVENT DELEGATION
            // The whole idea behind event delegation is rather than listening for a
            // click or a change on these checkboxes directly, what we do is we look for
            // somebody who is going to be on the page at the time of listening.
            //  So I always like to think of event delegation as very responsible parents, like UL with a class
            // of "plates," and very negligent children who don't necessarily hear any
            // instructions from the parents. So what we're saying is, "Hey, plates. When your
            // children inputs get clicked, can you please pass this click on to
            // them?" Rather than you handling the click directly, we're just telling you because
            // you're the only one responsible here.
