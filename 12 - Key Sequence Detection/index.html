            // Key sequencing detection means when someone inputs a certain sequence of keys
            // into your window or into an inputter, something like that, then something needs
            // to happen. And what this is used most for online is the Konami code which is, if you grew up in the 1980s or
            // 1990s, you'll know that you can type in up, up, down, down, left, right, left,
            // right, B, A, start, and what that will do is it will trigger like unlimited lives
            // in Mario or something like that. So, I figured out Buzzfeed, of all websites, has a Konami code.
            // If you go to the website and press up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, enter, and it changes
            // all the words to Wilkie, I'm not sure who that is, but it's pretty
            // funny. Different websites have little Easter eggs that you can
            // surface. So, let's see how that works.

            window.addEventListener('keyup', e => {
                console.log(e.key);
                pressed.push(e.key);
                // If negative, will begin that many elements from the end.
                pressed.splice(-secretCode.length - 1, pressed.length - secretCode.length);
                // contains appears to be deprecated. You should use includes instead.
                if (pressed.join('').includes(secretCode)) {
                    console.log('DING DING!');
                    cornify_add();
                }
                console.log(pressed);
            });
            let pressed = [];
            let secretCode = 'wesbos';
